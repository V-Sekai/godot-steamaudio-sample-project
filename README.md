ARCHIVED - With new responsibilities at my dayjob I do not personally have time to work on this or maintain it, but I hope it may serve as a decent launching point for others that wish to integrate Steam Audio with Godot or other engines. Steam Audio is really awesome tech, kudos to Valve!

To run this sample project, you will need a custom Godot build using the Godot Steam%reg;Audio module: https://github.com/vespergamedev/godot_steamaudio
